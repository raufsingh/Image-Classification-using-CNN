## Problem statement :
In this Section we are implementing Convolution Neural Network(CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images. The Total number of images available for training is 25,000 and final testing is done on seperate 10,000 images.

Note:This problem statement and dataset is taken from this Kaggle competition.
